TASK: 03 Insertion Sort

# Insertion Sort Tester
Generate an unsorted list (maybe use RNG). Implement:
- Insertion sort without using inbuild sorts
- Count number of comparions
Then benchmark them with random inputs.

TODO:
- Fill in functions
- Add demonstration code under `if __name__ == "__main__":`
